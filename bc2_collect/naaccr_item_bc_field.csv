If a patient has an Hispanic name, but there is reason to believe they are not Hispanic (e.g., the patient is Filipino, or the patient is a woman known to be non-Hispanic who has a Hispanic married name), the code in this field should be 0 (non-Spanish, non-Hispanic).

380.0,0380 Sequence Number-Central,v15_0380_sequence_numbercentral,,Sequence Number--Central,528,529,"Code indicates the sequence of all reportable neoplasms over the lifetime of the person. This data item differs from Sequence Number-Hospital [560], because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has had only one <i>in situ</i> or one malignant neoplasm as defined by the Federal reportable list (regardless of central registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more reportable neoplasms, but 02 indicates the second of two or more reportable neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person???s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the central registry (those that occur outside the registry catchment area or before the reference date) also are allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm preceded the central registry???s reference date._x000d_
_x000d_
<b>Reporting Requirements: Federally Required and State/Province Defined</b> _x000d_
The Federal or SEER/NPCR standard defining the reportable neoplasms is described in Chapter III, Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability. It is assumed that this shared standard is the ???minimum??? definition of reportability. Individual central cancer registries may define additional neoplasms as reportable._x000d_
_x000d_
Numeric codes in the 00-59 range indicate the sequence of neoplasms of <i>in situ</i> or malignant behavior (2 or 3) at the time of diagnosis, which SEER/NPCR standards require to be reported. Codes 60 to 87 indicate the sequence of non-malignant tumors (as defined in Chapter III) and any other neoplasms that the central registry has defined as reportable. Neoplasms required by SEER/NPCR with an <i>in situ</i> or malignant behavior at the time of diagnosis are sequenced completely independently of this higher-numbered category. Sequence Number-Hospital does not affect Sequence Number-Central. The two notational systems are independent but central registries should take Sequence Number-Hospital [560] into account when coding Sequence Number Central."

patient. The code may differ from the Sequence Number--Central [380] because the definitions of reportable_x000d_
neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. The two items also handle some types of tumors differently. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has only one malignant neoplasm in his lifetime (regardless of hospital registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more malignant neoplasms, while 02 indicates the second of two or more malignant neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person???s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the hospital registry are also allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm occurred before the hospital registry???s reference date. Similarly, Sequence Number 60 indicates the patient has only one non-malignant neoplasm, and Sequence Number 61 represents the first of multiple non-malignant neoplasms._x000d_

Nonanalytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility???s cancer program.
